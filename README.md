## What is this?
This is a torrent downloading tool, you enter your search query, select a torrent and the program will scrape the magnet link and hand it over to your default torrent application on your PC.
This should be compatible with every OS and torrent client out there, if for some reason your OS/BitTorrent client isn't supported then feel free to open an issue :)

## I Found a bug!
Great! A problem found is a problem solved, Please open an issue and I'll address it as soon as I can :)

## Installation
* pip install instanttorrent (pip3 if python2-pip is installed)
* Optionally install man page (instructions coming soon)

## Usage/Example

## TODO
